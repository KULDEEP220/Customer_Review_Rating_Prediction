0,they don't provide return and refund policy for Honor phones..my concern is my phone is overheating. they checked it but they set their limit of over heating which is 50 degree C. but mobile is overheating around 39-40 degree C. this temperature is also not safe to use phones. So request you people don't BUY HONOR smartphones.,1

Don't go for it, Honest Review!!

Camera being 13mp gives quality like 5mp or 8mp, battery so far is good after a day use, phone performance is worst than 2/16GB being 3/32GB, seems like Honor quality has been compromised (majorly in camera). Worst camera and poor performance phone from Honor I've ever encountered with. Everything else apart from Camera and Performance is good. Build Quality is nice, Speaker is great.
